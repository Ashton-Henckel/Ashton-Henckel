My name is Ashton Henckel, I am a 15-year-old student with basic coding experience.
I am working on a web project with others to build my resume and gain work experience.
I have experience using HTML and Java.  I can create basic scripts using those platforms.
I am looking to utilize GitHub as a host site to expand my coding knowledge and learn how to use coding in real-life scenarios.
I can be reached at ahenckel5231@gmail.com, please contact me for any offers or inquiries
